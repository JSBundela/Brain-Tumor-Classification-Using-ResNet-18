# Brain-Tumor-Classification-Using-ResNet-18

>Developed a deep learning model using ResNet-18 with transfer learning to classify MRI brain tumor images into four categories (glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, no tumor).

>Achieved 98% accuracy with precision (0.98), recall (0.98), and F1-score (0.98) through PyTorch and Torchvision.

>Handled class imbalance using stratified sampling and improved performance with learning rate and batch size tuning.

>Enhanced model generalization with data augmentation and evaluated using a confusion matrix and classification report.
